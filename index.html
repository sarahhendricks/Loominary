    <p style="color:#833D6D"><strong>Play Loominary using the loom of fate to weave the destinies of legends. Every choice adds to the fabric of the story!</strong></p>

<p>Loominary is a game system that uses a tabletop loom as the controller for the games. The games are written in Twine and the choices in the game are shown in distinct colors. The player weaves with the appropriate colored yarn to control the game, and in doing so weaves their choices into a scarf they are actively making through play. When game play is complete, the woven scarf will be unique to each player’s set of choices and exist as a more permanent record of their play session.
    </p>
    <p>
    	The project is open source, and along with all the source files we have included a guide for sourcing the materials and tutorials for putting it together. We also include three Twine games and a tutorial that walks the player through how to weave. Two of the games follow the Greek myths of Medusa and Oedipus and the third is a short child-friendly story about a day spent with Posy the Unicorn.

    <strong>Artist Statement</strong>
   <p>As storytelling is the basis of human communication, everyone’s a storyteller at heart. Narrative-based games have the capacity to support a broad range of story experiences, but there are large groups of voices that are currently underrepresented. Loominary is part of a research agenda with projects that focus on creating frameworks to support new storytelling experiences from underrepresented perspectives. In particular, crafting communities – which are often predominantly women – have created story artifacts for many years, but these stories have not been engaged computationally. Crafts have a rich history of both overt and subversive storytelling and bringing that depth to computational experiences creates unique methodologies and experiences for new audiences.
	 </p><p>
In the collaborative game project Loominary, the focus is on bridging the gap between computational and craft storytelling. As the player progresses through the game, the player’s choices for the characters are literally woven into a personalized tangible artifact of the players’ game session. The artifact can be “read” by a knowledgeable viewer that understands the visual language depicting the choices players made throughout their session.
